# VR Headset Gaming Analysis ML Foundations

A group project submitted for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Foundations at IE University, Madrid. 

The goal of the project was to provide a pricing and overall product analysis using Machine Learning Algorithms and statistical modeling techniques for a company, InnovateTech, that makes VR Gaming Headsets. The VR dataset was provided to us by Professor Lee.

Some of the most relevant features were User Rating, Resolution, Battery Life, Product Price, Comfort Score. These figures were provided for InnovateTech, as well as Competitor A, B, and C. 

We conducted data analysis utilizing Linear and Polynomial Regression, GAMS, LOESS and LOWESS, LASSO between company prices, product ratings and market trends allowing us to provide pricing strategies and potential product improvements.
